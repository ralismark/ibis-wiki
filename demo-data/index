# Welcome to ibis wiki!

This is just a demo site, with some demo files to give you an idea of what this is like. Any changes you make here will be lost when you leave or refresh this page.

To open a card, use the search bar at the top! New cards are automatically created when you open them.

**Markdown** is *fully supported* here, using the `@lezer/markdown` library <https://github.com/lezer-parser/markdown#user-content-delimitertype>.

In addition to the features provided by that library, links are also clickable! Try clicking the above link. Also, there are [[internal-links]] a la Roam Research (which was one of the inspirations for this).

For more info have a look at <https://github.com/ralismark/ibis-wiki>.

## Further usage

If you want to use this as an actual wiki, you'll need a [WebDAV] server that has [CORS] configured correctly (or alternatively: a WebDAV server and a cors proxy).

[WebDAV]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV
[CORS]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS

Then, open the Configuration Options below and set GET_URL and WEBDAV_URL to the URL of your server, including a trailing slash. You can also just use a subdirectory with e.g. `http://example.com/wiki/`. Then change STORAGE_TYPE to webdav, and reload.

Alternatively, you can use any s3-compatible backend, but this has only been around since mid April 2022, and isn't as stable (or as documented) as using WebDAV.

You can also customise what appears on startup by changing [[init.js]].
