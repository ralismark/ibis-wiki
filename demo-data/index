# Welcome to ibis wiki!

This is just a demo site, with some demo files to give you an idea of what this is like. Any changes you make here will be lost when you leave or refresh this page.

To open a card, use the search bar at the top! New cards are automatically created when you open them.

**Markdown** is *fully supported* here, using the `@lezer/markdown` library <https://github.com/lezer-parser/markdown#user-content-delimitertype>.

In addition to the features provided by that library, links are also clickable! Try clicking the above link. Also, there are [[internal-links]] a la Roam Research (which was one of the inspirations for this).

For more info have a look at <https://github.com/ralismark/ibis-wiki>.

## Further usage

If you want to use this as an actual wiki (please tell me if you do!), you'll need to "bring your own storage" in the form of an external WebDAV or S3 service. In both cases CORS will need to be configured correctly -- see <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS> for more info.

For WebDAV, set both WEBDAV_URL and GET_URL to the appropriate URL, including a trailing slash. You also specify a subdirectory with e.g. `https://example.com/wiki/`. Then change STORAGE_TYPE to webdav, and reload.

For S3, set S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID and S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to your credentials, S3_BUCKET to the root of your bucket. If you want to use a subdirectory, set S3_PREFIX. Finally, change STORAGE_TYPE to s3 and reload.

You can also customise what appears on startup by changing [[init.js]]. This file is fetched (via a regular HTTP GET request) from `{GET_URL}/init.js`. As such, it needs to be accessible that way.
